    "# 1.6 Ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify best customers\n",
    "\n",
    "The data science team would like to know your best ideas on how the sales data can be used to help identify the company's best customers.\n",

    "\n",
    "The data science team also has to come up with a way to synthesize the 3 dimensions into a single customer value for each customer.\n",

    "* Recency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine recency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monetary Value - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how the data can be used to determine monetary value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Synthesis - A brief paragraph explaining your ideas on how to synthesize the 3 dimensions of recency, frequency, and monetary value into a customer value for each customer and how to determine who the best customers are.\n",
